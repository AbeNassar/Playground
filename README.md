# Math Playground
This repository is really for my personal enjoyment; e.g. exploring new libraries, coding up problems that I'm thinking of or just a place to store code I might want later.

If you are not me and you reading this, then feel free to browse. However I should applogoize for all the incomplete work. 

I coded up some [simulations here](https://github.com/AbeNassar/Playground/tree/master/Simulations). I'll add things as I think of them.
